## Online Mathematics Test Application

This project is a React.js-based web application designed to facilitate online mathematics tests. It allows users to select specific math questions, take the test while recording the time taken for each question and the total time for the entire test. After completing the test, users can view their performance and the time taken for each question.

### Features

- Landing Page:
  - Input for user's name.
  - Checkbox selection for specific math questions.
  - Calculation of total test time based on selected questions.

- Test Page:
  - Timer to track the elapsed time during the test.
  - Display of math questions using the Better React Mathjax library.
  - Navigation controls for moving between questions.

- Finish Page:
  - Display of user's name.
  - Question IDs with time taken for each question.
  - Total time taken to complete the test.

### Development

This project was developed as a part of a software engineer intern interview task. It utilizes React.js for the frontend, makes API calls to fetch question details, and incorporates the Better React Mathjax library for rendering mathematical questions.
